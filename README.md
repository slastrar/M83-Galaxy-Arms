<h1>M83 Galaxy Arm Mapping Project</h1>

This university project focuses on analyzing and mapping the arms of the M83 galaxy. Gaussian Mixture Models were used for pattern identification in the stellar data, and advanced interpolation techniques from SciPy were applied to achieve an accurate representation of the galactic structure.

The data used was sourced from two different astronomical databases. The correspondence and analysis of stars from both datasets were essential for ensuring the quality and accuracy of the model.
